COO & Co-Founder at Subitt
[Visit Subitt](https://www.subitt.io)

My name is Jae and I enjoy building things and working on projects that make a difference. I want to eventually focus my time and resources on helping disadvantaged youths by providing them with more resources for success!

üíª Professional Journey:

Throughout my life, I've dipped my toes in a variety of fields including
* Accounting
* Digital Marketing
* Sales
* Business Management
* Web Development

And now I am the COO & Co-Founder of Subitt where I manage the day-to-day operation and make sure our customers are getting the full experience. And, I still code parts of the platform!

üåê Projects:

I enjoy tech projects so have done many personal and team projects using technologies including

* JavaScript (React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Vue.js, jQuery)
* TypeScript
* Python (Django)
* CSS (SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind)
* HTML (Of course üôÑ)
* PHP
* SQL, MySQL
* Bash, Linux


Using these technologies I've created:

* A Python script to make listening to music more acessible (who wants to pay a monthly subscription or listen to ads every other song? üò´)
* Full stack web applications
* * [Subitt](https://www.subitt.io), an online platform for centralizing all things subscriptions.
  * 
* A social mobile app (still in the works üòâ)
* Natural Language Processor

I've also learned

* Go (Golang)
* C#

üåü Goals:

The only reason why I am where I am today, (which I still feel isn't much), is because of the opportunities and resources given by selfless mentors and leaders. I want to get to a place where I can provide similar help to youths who otherwise might not be able to get those resources. That's later down the road though.
