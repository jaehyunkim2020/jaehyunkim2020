COO & Co-Founder at Subitt
[Visit Subitt](https://www.subitt.io)

My name is Jae and I'm a Computer Science student. I like building things and working on projects that make a difference. I want to eventually focus my time and resources on helping disadvantaged youths by providing them with more resources for success!

💻 Professional Journey:

Throughout my life, I've dipped my toes in a variety of fields including
* Accounting
* Marketing & Sales
* Business Mangement
* HR
* Web Development

And now I am the COO & Co-Founder of Subitt where I manage the day-to-day operation and make sure our customers are getting the full experience. But, I still code from time to time.

🌐 Projects:

I enjoy tech projects so have done many personal and team projects using technologies including

* JavaScript (React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Vue.js)
* Python (Django)
* CSS (SCSS, Bootstrap, Tailwind)
* HTML (Of course 🙄)
* PHP

Using these technologies I've created:

* A Python script to make listening to music more acessible (who wants to pay a monthly subscription or listen to ads every other song? 😫)
* Full stack web applications
* A social mobile app (still in the works 😉)
* Natural Language Processor

🌟 Goals:

The only reason why I am where I am today, (which I still feel isn't much), is because of the opportunities and resources given by selfless mentors and leaders. I want to get to a place where I can provide similar help to youths who otherwise might not be able to get those resources. That's later down the road though.
